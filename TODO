D If block command not ended before end of token list reached, fudge end

* Remove Compiler options
* Don't need a :source option - #compile should accept a filename; #parse should accept raw template content. That's it.
* DefaultPreprocessor - rename to Filters or something
* Move code in Commands::Filter to Filters

* All subclasses of BlockCommand should not override initialize() or add() unless necessary
* Should we add attr_accessors for all instance variables for easier access during
  testing?
