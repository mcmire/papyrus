TODO

D Currently we don't support [foo] variables - in Compiler we should treat sub as
  variable before treating as modifier or closer or command name
D ContextItem#get should not return an error string but an empty string
  
* Remove :source option for Compiler. #compile should accept a filename; #parse should
  accept raw template content. That's it.
* DefaultPreprocessor - rename to Filters or something
* All subclasses of BlockCommand should not override initialize() or add() unless necessary
* Should we add attr_accessors for all instance variables for easier access during
  testing?
* Parser should not be a ContextItem - the top-level context should be Template.
  In that case Template's parent is nil, not the parser.
