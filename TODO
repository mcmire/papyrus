TODO

* Delete Source, FileSource, StringSource, DefaultLexicon, Lexicon, Compiler

* If doesn't properly work -- what about something like:

  [if foo == 'bar']  # this line here.. equal sign??
    aslfkjdsfsd
  [else]
    aslkfjsldkfj
  [/if]
  
  In Diary-X, we never had this problem because it was sort of Lispish -- so
  
  [if == [foo] 42]
  
  Here, I think we'll have to copy from Liquid.

* DefaultPreprocessor - rename to Filters or something
* Move code in Commands::Filter to Filters

* Update documentation!!

* All subclasses of BlockCommand should not override initialize() or add() unless necessary
* Should we add attr_accessors for all instance variables for easier access during
  testing?
