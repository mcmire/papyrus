TODO

D Modify Compiler to not accept DefaultLexicon anymore
* Get rid of method_separator_regexp (Compiler, ContextItem#get)

* Currently we don't support [foo] variables - in Compiler we should treat sub as
  variable before treating as modifier or closer or command name
  
* Remove Command#closed_by? - [/for] notation should be hard-coded in parser
  I think. Also be sure #end method of BlockCommand and subclasses is removed.
  
* Remove :source option for Compiler. #compile should accept a filename; #parse should
  accept raw template content. That's it.
* DefaultPreprocessor - rename to Filters or something
* All subclasses of BlockCommand should not override initialize() or add() unless necessary
* Should we add attr_accessors for all instance variables for easier access during
  testing?
