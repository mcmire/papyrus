TODO

* Why is context optional? Shouldn't it always be required (except for Template)?

* If doesn't properly work -- what about something like:

  [if foo == 'bar']  # this line here.. equal sign??
    aslfkjdsfsd
  [else]
    aslkfjsldkfj
  [/if]
  
  In Diary-X, we never had this problem because it was sort of Lispish -- so
  
  [if == [foo] 42]
  
  Here, I think we'll have to copy from Liquid.

* Update documentation!!

* Should we add attr_accessors for all instance variables for easier access during
  testing?
