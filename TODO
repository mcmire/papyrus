TODO

* Replace Loop with For

* We need ContextItem#get and family to raise a VariableNotFound error if we never
  found the variable, which Parser and places will pick up on -- instead of going
  by whether or not the value is nil. Also, that way stuff like one.two.three will
  fail if one.two == nil.
* Do we need Include anymore? Comment?

* Parser#tokenize should group together quoted arguments too?
* When vars are mass-set, stringify keys?

* Better if statement parsing -- copy from Liquid. The if command either accepts one arg (value), or three args (value1, op, value2).

FUTURE

* Should we add attr_accessors for all instance variables for easier access during
  testing?
