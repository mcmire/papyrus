TODO

Last updated: 3 Aug 2008

- Add ability to refer to variables without 'var' prefix (variables take precedence to function calls). This requires fundamentally changing how commands are resolved, and possibly how commands are defined.
- Add nested commands
- Add ability to wrap arguments in single or double quotes (see Liquid)
- Add constants for common regex patterns (quotes, variables, etc.) (see Liquid)
- Support [/for] as well as [endfor]
- Put modifiers on the command level (except for 'end', which will be automatic for Blocks)


- There are some Command subclasses whose output methods receive a required context parameter, and some for which that parameter is optional. What gives? (They should probably all be required, just to be consistent.)
- Currently to add a filter, a method must be added to the DefaultPreprocessor. Add a 'filter' class method to Lexicon that automatically does this.
- What's Processor for? Should this be more of an interface? (How do you inherit class methods?)
- Rename instances of 'command' with 'sub' or 'token' as appropriate?
  - Sub::Base < Token
  - Macro < Sub::Base
  - Sub::Variable < Sub::Base
  - Command::Text -> Token::Text
  - Command::{Base, Case, Comment, Define, Filter, If, Include, Loop, Unknown} -> Macro::{$1}
  - Command::Value -> Sub::Variable
  - Rename Stackable to Stacking -- it's not an interface!
- I don't like the 'modifier' Lexicon macro -- we should really have like a :modifiers => [] option to 'define' (so define the modifier on the sub level)
- Standardize behaviors of Command#add -- for instance, Filter#add supposedly just adds text, but then Filter#output calls #output on each of the items in the @text variable -- so they're actually commands. Shouldn't Command#add *always* add a command to a list of commands? (or at least for Stackable)
- What's up with Parser.recent_parser ? Why do even need this?
- Some commands' #output methods return an error message (e.g. Include). We don't
  want this.
- [% foo %-] to remove line breaks (just like <%= foo -%>)
- Should certain classes like Block and Stackable inherit from Array or maybe include Addable or something?
