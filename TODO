TODO

* Modify all Command subclasses to accept two args: command_name and args
* Modifier methods (e.g. Case#when) should just get passed their args
* Support [/for] notation
* Get rid of method_separator_regexp (Compiler, ContextItem#get)
* Lexicon
  * define can be a lot simpler - no regexp option, no aliases - just keep an array
    of available commands
  * Remove closer_on, adv_define, global_var, global_modifier, closer
* DefaultLexicon - do we even need this anymore? Maybe we need just a YAML file...
  Or, push all definition stuff into the classes themselves.. that would work.
* Remove :source option for Compiler. #compile should accept a filename; #parse should
  accept raw template content. That's it.
* DefaultPreprocessor - rename to Filters or something
* All subclasses of Stackable should not override initialize() or add() unless necessary
* Should we add attr_accessors for all instance variables for easier access during
  testing?
* Should Command::Text even be a command (seems like it could be grouped with Block,
  Stackable, and Value)? The only thing it has in common is the #output method... 
* We probably don't need UnknownCommand anymore
