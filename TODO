TODO

# Add functional tests for all commands
* Does [unless]...[/unless] work?
* We need ContextItem#get and family to raise a VariableNotFound error if we never
  found the variable, which Parser and places will pick up on -- instead of going
  by whether or not the value is nil. Also, that way stuff like one.two.three will
  fail if one.two == nil.
* Test inner subs, within quotes and without
* Replace Loop with For
* Do we need Include anymore? Comment?
* Update documentation!!

* Better if statement parsing -- copy from Liquid. The if command either accepts one arg (value), or three args (value1, op, value2).

FUTURE

* Should we add attr_accessors for all instance variables for easier access during
  testing?
