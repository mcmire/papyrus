# 'title' = 'Getting It'

h2. The Easy Way

I finally got around to making a 
"RubyGems":http://rubygems.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl gem package of 
PageTemplate available. This means that you can install the latest 
release of PageTemplate with one simple command:

<pre class="console">
gem install -r PageTemplate
</pre>

You can always download your own copy of the gem file and install
locally, if that's your preference:

<pre class="console">
gem install -l PageTemplate
</pre>

h2. The Slightly Less Easy Way

Maybe you don't use RubyGems, or you just don't feel like mucking
about with the gem system at all. That's okay, I've got you covered.
You only need to download and install the source package from Rubyforge.

h3. Download

In order to save on the bandwidth for my home machine, I've opened
a "RubyForge":http://rubyforge.org/ account for
PageTemplate. That means that you can always find the latest version
of the PageTemplate package from my project download page:

bq. "http://rubyforge.org/projects/pagetemplate/":http://rubyforge.org/projects/pagetemplate/

Once you've downloaded the latest version, unpack it into a temporary or 
source directory.

<pre class="console">
$ tar xfvzC PageTemplate-1_2_0.tar.gz ~/src/
</pre>

h3. Test

If you have Ruby 1.8, or <a href="http://testunit.talbott.ws/">Test::Unit</a>
installed on your machine, you can run the test cases that are
used during development of PageTemplate.

<pre class="console">
$ ruby -w TC_PageTemplate.rb
</pre>

If you get messages about any sort of failures, please let me know! I know 
that the tests run smoothly on my machine, but I have no idea how it'll work 
on yours.

h3. Install

h4. Using @install.rb@

PageTemplate uses the standard ruby @install.rb@ script for installation, 
which makes the process very easy:

<pre class="console">
ruby install.rb config
ruby install.rb setup
(su or sudo)
ruby install.rb install
</pre>

h4. Using Rake

If you have the "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org/ tool, you can use that to 
take care of testing and installing PageTemplate.

<pre class="console">
rake
sudo rake install
</pre>
