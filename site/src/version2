# 'title' = 'PageTemplate Version 2'
# 'subtitle' = "What's New?"

Thanks largely to Greg Millam there is a new release of PageTemplate.
Thanks entirely to Greg Millam, it is a complete revamping of PT's
internal workings. While the basics of using PageTemplate as covered
by the other pages on this site are pretty much the same, a few things
have been added.

h2. New Features

h3. The Preprocessor

h4. @reverse@

Amaze your friends! Baffle your enemies! Discover palindromes in your spare time!

This is a simple demonstration of the capabilities of PageTemplate's preprocessor. It prints out the
reversed string of the value being displayed.

<pre class="code">
Hello, [%var name%]. Your name spelled backwards is [%var name :reverse%].
</pre>

<pre class="sample">
Hello, Brian Wisti. Your name spelled backwards is itsiW nairB.
</pre>

h4. escapeHTML

<pre class="code">
Here comes some sample HTML escaped.

[%var html :escapeHTML %]
</pre>

Here comes some sample HTML escaped.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://hack.your.email.ownzr.com/'&gt;Update your &lt;strong&gt;PayPal&lt;/strong&gt; account!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

h4. escapeURI

<pre>[%var url :escapeURI %]</pre>

And here's a URI-escaped string. Isn't the preprocessor great?

h3. Case Directive

h3. Object-style Variable Access

h3. Handling Templates "On the Fly"
